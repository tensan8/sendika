# Sendika: Next-Gen Drugs Development Helper
This project was made for Bayer Digital Campus Challenge 2021

## About
Developing a particular drug for a specific disease may take much time and cost much money. There will be many trials and errors to test whether a particular compound can cure the disease or not. In order to help the researchers in doing the works in drugs development to be more efficient, Sendika was introduced.

Sendika is an AI prototype that was developed by **Bryan Austyn Ichsan** and **Alesandro Michael Ferdinand**, under the supervision of **Dr. Lee Sue Han**, **Dr. Joel Than Chia Ming**, and **Dr. Xavier Chee**. Sendika can predict whether a particular compound can be the inhibitor for HIV or not; thus, the researchers can save their time and money to do the lab testing with the higher chance of inhibition compound only.

Sendika will predict the pIC50 value of a certain SMILES input. The users can type the SMILES representation of the compound in the provided field, and Sendika will predict how possible it is to be the inhibitor of HIV; hence the HIV infection process can be stopped.
